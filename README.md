## SDN-Based DoS Attacks and Mitigation

In this lab, we wanted to set up and use an SDN-based DoS attack and mitigation by setting up layer 3 firewall rules. In this lab we set up a software defined network based on mininet, containernet, POX controller, and OVS. We created an SDN infrastructure in a VirtualBox VM which had Ubuntu/Linux installed. Then we set up a layer 3 SDN-based firewall to control and filter DoS attack traffic on the target host.
